## Summary
<Brief overview of what the project does, its purpose, and what makes it unique. One or two paragraphs explaining its core idea or motivation.>

---

## Parts
- <Component 1>  
- <Component 2>  
- <Component 3>  
(Include voltages, currents, model numbers, or key specs if relevant.)

---

## Design and Logic
<Explain how the circuit, code, or mechanism works. Describe the data flow or control logic.  
If it’s a physical build, talk about the mechanical or electronic design choices and how everything interacts.>

---

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
<List the key problems you ran into during prototyping or debugging, and what you did to solve or work around them.  
If some problems weren’t fully solved, note what you learned or what might fix them next time.>

---

## Design Improvements
<Reflect on what you’d change in a second version — electrical, structural, or code optimizations.  
Include any advice you’d give yourself or others attempting a similar build.>

---

## Code
```cpp
// Include the main code here if relevant
```
